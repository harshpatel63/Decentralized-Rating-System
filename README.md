## Decentralized Hospital Rating System

Meta health tries to solve the problems in hospital rating and introduces a rating system that is just based on patient's reviews and is decentralized and safe from manipulations.

## Why do we require a decentralized rating system ?

 - Current rating systems are centralized having complete control over the ratings database.
 - Central authorities can edit / delete negative ratings to avoid their defamation.
 - It can led to huge rating scams with a purpose to attract buyers
 - 
 ## How will Blockchain solve this problem ?
- A Blockchain network is a decentralized, distributed ledger which has rigorous Cryptographic concepts, Consensus mechanisms which makes it reliable, trustworthy and impossible to hack.
- Anything written in blockchain canâ€™t be removed unless done legally, making rating systems  - consumer friendly.
 - It will also ensure that our system doesn't have a single point of failure.
