                <p>Our system tries to solve all of this problems in hospital rating and introduces a rating system that is just based on patients' reviews and is decentralized and safe from manipulations.</p>
                <h3>Why do we require a decentralized rating system ?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Current rating systems are centralized having complete control over the ratings database.</li>

                    <li>It can led to huge rating scams with a purpose to attract buyers.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>How will Blockchain solve this problem ?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A Blockchain network is a decentralized, distributed ledger which has rigorous Cryptographic concepts, Consensus mechanisms which makes it reliable, trustworthy and impossible to hack.</li>
                    <li>Anything written in blockchain canâ€™t be removed unless done legally, making rating systems consumer friendly.</li>
                    <li>It will also ensure that our system doesn't have a single point of failure.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Feature</h3>
                <ul>
